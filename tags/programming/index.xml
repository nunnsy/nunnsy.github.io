Naturally, I turned to Python due to my familiarity. 🐍🐍🐍
Unfortunately, Pillow didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work well for images with an alpha channel, particularly when resizing and transposing.
Instead, I ended up using scikit-image to load image data into NumPy arrays and manipulate it from there.
This short snippet allowed me to achieve transparent image layering.</description></item></channel></rss>
