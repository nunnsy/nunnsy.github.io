## üá¨üáß I moved to the UK

Hooray! This is a little page full of titbits that were important to me in my move, either because I researched them prior to moving, or only found out having landed on British soil.

## ‚òéÔ∏è Phones

My decision for a SIM came down to 3 points; city bandwidth, roaming and value (or cost).

In Australia, you were usually worried whether Telstra would reach the remote expanses of land you travelled to. In England, or rather London specifically, I am more concerned about a mobile network having enough bandwidth in the city. Your reception may be top-notch, but if the carrier doesn't have room to send your data through their pipes, it will be a slow browsing experience. There's some anecdotal postings on online forums as to which carriers perform better than others. **Honestly, I haven't a clue.** What I found though was Voxi (carried by Vodafone) generally worked as expected around London, with the exception being going to a large event (football games, etc).

For me, having Europe on your doorstep is a new experience (as opposed to 20 hours of flying). To make the travel easier, having EU roaming included on my SIM makes the month-to-month bill cheaper and removes another item to check off the travel list. Unfortunately, Voxi have ended their included EU roaming with their standard packages. 02 do have EU inclusive, though with Brexit most carriers have been slowly switching this to a paid extra. Something to be mindful of when selecting a phone plan.

Lastly, the cost and value. Sure, you can get 100GB+ for a fair amount of money, though there are cheaper options which will still cater to most users. Voxi are great for unmetered social media (includes Twitter üê¶, huge for me). 02 still have EU roaming. Other providers are even cheaper, though their bandwidth may be questionable. Generally, BT/EE and Vodafone have the most premium plans. Three is affordable (though many stories about low bandwidth), and a there's a bunch of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) which are highly competitive.

TL;DR: My thought process: Voxi good, 02 better on plan for EU roaming.

## üè¶ Banks

### Choosing a bank

Most banks are fine. They're insured, offer customer service, and let you move money around.

There are some digital banks such as Monzo, Starling, Revolut (although not *technically* a bank in the UK). These can come with some great benefits, though they have no physical presence in the world. Depending on what your requirements are, one of these may be great.

For those eligible for premier banking in the UK, it is worth reading the benefits (and potentially associated cost) with their accounts. Most of the 'high street banks' will have premier offerings, each with their benefits. If you currently, or will, meet their eligibility criteria, it is worth investigating how one of these accounts may work for you. For example, HSBC UK currently offer included international travel insurance for your overseas trips.

Chase have recently entered the UK market and offer a debit card with no increase over the Mastercard exchange rate. On this note, I'm in the process of upgrading my website, [CardRat.es](https://cardrat.es/) to include UK offerings.

### Credit cards

This was frustrating, until it wasn't. Even with banks present in the UK and existing globally, a credit report doesn't necessarily cross the borders with you. Most banks I found were unwilling to use credit history outside the UK. The exception; American Express. AMEX were more than happy to use the credit history I had with them in Australia to provide me with a new British card. I would recommend talking to them as early as possible when thinking of an overseas move so they can engage their global transfers team.

Another fantastic feature of credit cards in the UK, beside the usual protection they offer, is the [Section 75 Act](https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumers/complaints-can-help/credit-borrowing-money/goods-services-bought-credit) applicable to them. I hope nobody ever needs to use this protection, though with some pricer purchases, a consumer can have peace of mind of shared liability between the seller and credit provider.

## ‚öïÔ∏è NHS Number

Although you don't need an NHS Number for medical treatment, it can be useful to have in other circumstances (i.e. a proof-of-recovery certificate for some international borders). To get one, one simply needs to register with a local NHS GP in the area. This is free.

More information can be found on the [NHS Website](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/about-the-nhs/what-is-an-nhs-number/).

## üí∞ National Insurance Number

Again, the National Insurance (NI) Number is one of those numbers you don't *need* to begin work. However, it can be useful to have one, especially for those wishing to open an [ISA](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts). To apply, information can be found on the [UK Government website](https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number). Some more personal views on these can be found toward the end.

## üè† Finding a home

A quick list:
- Don't blindly choose where to live by suburb, housing and the vibe of an area can change within a block in London.
- Everything is paid monthly.
- Council tax (and energy now) is significant and should be factored before looking at the PCM cost of a place.
- A lease of 12 months with no break clauses is fairly standard at the moment. At times, this term could be extended.
- Ensure you have a holding deposit ready when on your rental search.
- Take a good look around the place before the rental application to note anything that needs to be fixed/changed. It helps to have a clause where this (as well as a professional clean) should be fixed before you grab your keys.

## ü§∑ Other things

### ISAs

These 'Individual Savings Accounts' give you a capital gains tax (CGT) free way of making your money work for you. There are a few offerings including cash/interest-based, stocks and shares, as well as 'innovative' ISAs and 'lifetime' ISAs. At the time of writing, one can contribute up to ¬£20,000 a year cumulatively into these accounts. The [UK Government website](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts) has a great deal of information on how these work and could be very useful for those wanting to grow their capital. One thing to note is the stocks and shares ISA, brokers will usually only let you long assets (and not trade on margin).

### Trading US ETFs

The FCA have decided that only ['professional' investors](https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/COBS/3/5.html) may buy US ETFs as they do not have the appropriate, roughly 3-page document, outlining the risks of ETF investments, unlike the UK/EU issued ETFs. There are quite a few equivalent ETFs available in the UK, though they tend to add a few bips of management fees on top. There are situations for many where one may hold a margin account and be allowed to short a single US stock...though they cannot long a US ETF for long-term investment.

### Transport

Transport for London (TfL) use NFC card scanners for travel on busses and trains. These card systems, previously exclusively working with their Oyster card, now allow the use of Mastercard, Visa and AMEX. As long as you have a bank card, you can travel no worries.

## ü§î Final thoughts

This is just my experience and frustrations. I do not have any certificates or advisory qualifications to recommend you any of the above products. I hope this list may serve you to at least save a few minutes when planning for your next big adventure. Good luck!
